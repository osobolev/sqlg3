/**
 * Adds transaction control methods to {@link ISimpleTransaction} - {@link #commit()}
 * and {@link #rollback()}. Business method calls on objects, obtained from
 * {@link ITransaction#getInterface(Class)} are not automatically committed or rolled back.
 * ITransaction holds resources (DB connection) until explicit call to {@link #commit()}
 * or {@link #rollback()}, so you must call one of them once you start transaction
 * (else resource leak may occur).
 * If single-connection pool is used, then you cannot call something from other transactions
 * (even from simple transactions) during active transaction - they have to wait until single
 * DB connection is released by the current transaction. In most cases violation of this rule
 * leads to deadlock, so if you are using ITransaction then all data access interfaces should
 * by obtained from it, not from other transactions.
